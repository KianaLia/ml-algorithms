# What is inside?

I every part of the project, a different Machine Learning algorithm is implemented and used to perform a task. the projects cover a wide range of side taks such as plotting the datasets, feature mapping and more. here is a short summary of every part of the project:

* **ex1** : Linear Regression for a simple regression
* **ex2** : Logistic Regression a simple regression
* **ex3** : One-vs-all Logistic Regression (multi class) and Neural Network for a handwriting recognition task
* **ex4** : Backpropagation algorithm for Neural Network using it for hand-written digit recognition
* **ex5** : Regularized Linear Regression using it to study models with different bias-variance properties
* **ex6** : Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifer
* **ex7** : K-means clustering and applying it to compress an image. In the second part, a principal component analysis is used to to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.
* **ex8** : an implementation of Anomaly Detection algorithm for detecting failing servers on a network. In the second part, a collaborative Filtering based movie recommender system is implemented.

## How to use

in every folder, there is a .m file with the same name as the folder (for example ex1.m in ex1 folder). this file is the main file and all implemented modules are used in this file respectively. So you can run each project by running the main file as follows:

```bash
  ex[number].m
```
